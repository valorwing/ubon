# UBON (Universal Binary Object Notation)

UBON is a highly efficient, binary serialization format designed to be a simpler and more lightweight alternative to Protocol Buffers, while maintaining the ease of use and flexibility of JSON. UBON offers significant data compression, making it an ideal solution for IoT and other data-intensive applications.

## Features

- **High Compression**: UBON compresses data up to 10 times compared to JSON, without losing performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Minimal codebase and low entry threshold, designed for developers of all levels.
- **Versatile**: Supports all standard data types, including nested objects and arrays.
- **Cross-Platform**: Initially implemented in Go, with plans for support in Python, C++, C, C#, JavaScript, PHP, and Rust.
- **Open Source**: Released under the GNU GPL license, ensuring it is free to use and modify.
